# Interleaf

Interleaf was inspired by the Airwindows design of interleaving signals together, and I combined that with my own reimplementation of the RBJ Biquads to create an EQ with up to 10 interleaves per band.

## Filter Types
 - Low Pass
 - High Pass
 - Band Pass
 - Notch
 - Peaking
 - Low Shelf
 - High Shelf

## Other features

 - 2 times oversampling
 - Interleaving of 2 through 10 filters, or none at all
 - Input/Output gain + Dry/Wet balance

## Should I use this over XYZ?
I liked the sound of interleaving and the quirks it can introduce to the signal, hence making this plugin.
It's neither transparent nor too colored in my opinion, but free to enjoy for everyone.
If you like it great! I don't claim it to be anything better than XYZ plugin.
